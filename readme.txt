== Screenshots ==

1. Glass: Adds blur effect. You can change the color and the opacity as well.

2. Kinetic: This effect minimizes the featured image and displays the information on a boxed background. You can change to any background color you wish.

3. 
Vertblack: Vertblack is classic and elegant. It adds a colored layer that works as a background for the title and the subtitle. Color # and opacity are customizable.

4. Centblack: Centblack adds the exact same effects as Vertblack. The main difference between the two layouts is the animation; While with Vertblack, the text scrolls from the two horizontal sides of the image, with Centblack, it appears from the center.

5. Single portfolio item standard: Single item arrangement works perfectly when you want to a slider looking design. You may upload as many photos as you wish and add more information. 

6. Single portfolio item reversed: You may also choose the standard design with the text on the right or reversed if you prefer to move the text to the left.
